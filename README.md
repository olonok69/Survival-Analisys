Model selection based on predictive power
If censoring is present, itâ€™s not appropriate to use a loss function like mean-squared-error or mean-absolute-loss. Instead, one measure is the concordance-index, also known as the c-index. This measure evaluates the accuracy of the ranking of predicted time. It is in fact a generalization of AUC, another common loss function, and is interpreted similarly:
0.5 is the expected result from random predictions,
1.0 is perfect concordance and,
0.0 is perfect anti-concordance (multiply predictions with -1 to get 1.0)
